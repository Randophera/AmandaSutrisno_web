            <p class="work_text">Humans have constantly tried to run faster since the earliest Olympic Games (c. 776 BC), 
                featuring the Stade, a footrace around a stadium. As records become broken and next-generation running shoes 
                are developed, this begs the question, what is the speed limit? Recently, researchers at Vanderbilt University have 
                proposed a special type of running shoe that enables a human to run 50% faster, <mark class="m_text_green">a super 
                    shoe that would allow the world's fastest man to reach 18 m/s as opposed to 12.3m/s with current running shoes</mark>

            <p class="work_hidden_text" id="htext_1" >How can a bicycle, which adds weight to a human(12kg) and supplies no external energy, 
                allow a human to move at 75% faster than running? Moreover, how can a bicycle do this when traditional running shoes or 
                even battery-powered exoskeletons are yet to succeed? Using theoretical analysis, the researchers found that the bicycle 
                is fundamentally faster than any running shoe partly because:
                <br><br>
                1. wheels support the body weight.
                <br>
                2. wheels allow the legs avoid energy losses from the feet contacting the ground.
                <br>
                3. pedals enable the legs to continuously supply energy in mid-air.
                <br><br>
                In contrast, in running the legs can only supply energy when pushing against the ground 
                but not when the leg is swinging in the air. The researchers realized that this disparity 
                between running mechanics and bicycle mechanics makes the legs able to supply energy 100% 
                of the time in cycling but only 20% of the time in natural running.
                <br>
                <img src="img/running_paper.jpg" style="margin-left:10%; width: 80%;">
                <br>
                Learning from the bicycle, we invented a method for the legs to supply energy during swing 
                to emulate the function of the pedals in cycling. In the proposed running shoe, the legs 
                supply energy during swing by compressing a spring, which later releases its stored energy 
                on the ground to power forward motion. The running shoe also requires a special type of 
                spring, i.e one that is capable of changing its stiffness, such that the spring can exert 
                greater forces against the ground without changing its stored energy. This novel approach 
                to superhuman augmentation is necessary to support the body weight, redirect vertical 
                motion, and increase the running speed, all within the short ground contact time during 
                high speed running.
                <br><br>
                From simulations, it was found that an ideal running shoe would allow the fastest man on 
                 to use their legs 96% of the step time to reach 20.9m/s forward speed. This speed is 
                 comparable to the top speed of cycling, 21.4m/s. We also found that a practical running 
                 shoe that could only allow the fastest man on earth to use their legs 60% of the step 
                 time would still lead to 18m/stop speed, which is significantly higher than the current 
                 12.3m/s in 100-m sprint. This result shows that the limit of human performance has not 
                 been reached and motivates new research in developing shoes that could enable superhuman 
                 performance.

                was synthesized, marking the first time robust topologically protected phenomena was detected in a real material. Today, we have not only engineered 
                a sophisticated topological system based on knotted structures, but also realized it with low-cost, ubiquitous electrical components" said Dr.

                A rather unusual aspect of the momentum space knots is the existence of a smoking gun electrical signature at the boundary of the nodal knot metal, 
                commonly known as the "drumhead states". Measuring drumhead states in solid materials is however highly challenging, and typically requires state-of-the-art 
                instruments, such as high energy synchrotron X-rays and ultrahigh vacuum environments. In contrast, probing drumhead states in topolectrical circuits 
                requires only simple electrical measurements which can be readily carried out in most labs.

                <mark class="m_text_lpurple">"Topological effects require very precise values of inductor/capacitor components. To counteract this difficulty, we used machine learning to find 
                variations of the circuit design which displayed the same topological phenomena but can be constructed using less precisely made parts." said 
                Amanda Sustrino, a research team member from the Singapore University of Technology and Design.
                Aided by machine learning algorithms and electronics simulations, the team has designed topolectrical circuits operating at 'sweet spots' that are 
                particularly robust against electrical noise. This novel design allows the elusive electrical signatures of drumhead states to be unambiguously identified.</mark>
