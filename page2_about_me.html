        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p class="p_text">I was born in Jakarta, Indonesia in the mid 90s, and attended the Australian International School for most of my K-12 education. During high school
            I developed a love for game programming through the modding community for the games Minecraft and The Sims series, and taught myself how to code C++. 
            <br><br>
            After high school, I moved to Singapore(the country and city) to do my undergraduate degree in Engineering Product Development at the 
            <a href="https://epd.sutd.edu.sg/">Singapore University of Technology and Design.</a>. The department was very multi-disciplinary and hired faculty from all the 
            science branches and most engineering discplines besides computer science. This gave students plenty of freedom in choosing courses, with myself taking a mixture
            of electrical engineering and physics classes, with undergraduate researh in theoretical quantum mechanics.
            <br><br>
            During my undergraduate studies, as an international student I accepted a <a href="https://tgonline.moe.gov.sg/tgis/normal/index.action">fellowship from the 
            Singapore government</a> which greatly reduced my tuition in exchange for a three year bond to live and work in the country. After graduation I briefly worked 
            in the semiconductor industry for Micron Technology as a product engineer, applying my quantum mechanics knowledge into improving
            the yield of manufacturing lines for flash memory chips. Working in industry made me feel a yearning for research and so I returned to my undergraduate institution to
            work as a research engineer for 2.5 years in preparation for graduate school once I finished my bond. During this time I published 3 journal papers and 1 conference paper.
            <br><br>
            When my bond was over, I applied and accepted a PhD student position with Dr. David Braun, one of my previous
            research collaborators, at Vanderbilt University, which I am currently employed.</p>

            I intend to develop the next generation of robotics using passive mechanisms which are flexible, 3D printable, and do not require a power-source
            to display intelligent behavior or exert force on the environment. This is opposed to traditional robotics which are rigid, assembled from separate machined steel parts, 
            and require batteries and motors to display any intelligence or exert any forces on the environment.
            <br><br>
            After graduation I would like to take my talents in simulation/optimization to work in the US software industry to algorithmically design passive mechanisms using
            artificial intelligence. For interested emplolyers, <mark class="m_text_green">I am legally authorized to work in the US from my Form I-551 (Permanent Resident Card/Greencard).</mark>
